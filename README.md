# DynamicOpmodeLoader

The dynamic opmode loader library allows teams to make changes to and upload opmodes without needing to recompile and upload the entire robot controller app. It integrates with all of your teams existing modules without any changes. Roadrunner is integrated into it so paths can be quickly uploaded and tweaked using our Roadrunner path tool.
